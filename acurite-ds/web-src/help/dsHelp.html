<p>
The Acurite data source records data from Acurite weather stations. There are many variants of the AcuRite weather stations and sensors.  
This data source will likely work with the consoles that have a USB interface such as models 01025, 01035, 02032C, and 02064C.
</p>

<p>After connecting the console to Mango via USB the data source will automatically detect it and read information for any points you have configured.  
	The internals of the console only update periodically so high poll rates will not result it better data reads. The update rates are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>wind speed: 18s</li>
  <li>wind direction: 36s</li>
  <li>outdoor temperature: 36s</li>
  <li>outdoor humidity: 36s</li>
  <li>rain: 36s</li>
  <li>indoor temperature: 60s</li>
  <li>pressure: 60s</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b>The console does not respond to USB requests when in mode 1 or mode 2.</p>
