<h1>Algorithms</h1>
Understanding the timing for the module is important and will be described here.  
Anytime one of the Controller Point's values is set the event is counted, the control loop is only executed after the configured "Sample Periods" are counted.

This means that the controller is not running its own poll for the data, it is event driven by changes on the inputs.  It is the user's responsibility to ensure 
that the input events are periodic enough to get the Control response desired.


Currently only the PID algorithm is available.

Before creating a Controller you must configure an Algorithm for the Controller to use.

<b>PID</b>
A PID control loop has 4 parameters:

<ul>
    <li>Sample Period is the number of value changes of the inputs to wait before executing the loop.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
