<ul>
    <li>Enabled - if the point is used in the controller</li>

    <li>Delay - how many sample periods should the values for this point be offset to the others</li>
    <li>High Limit - highest possible value (for outputs)</li>
    <li>Low Limit - lowest possible value (for outputs)</li>
    <li>Data Point - the Mango data point that is used</li>
    <li>Controller - the controller that uses this point</li>
