<h1>Transfer Functions</h1>
Ensure the propert transfer function is selected to ensure convergence to a solution.
<br>
When setting up a network, in addition to selecting the Transfer Function there may be tunable settings for it.  See the list below for available options.
<br>
<b>Gaussian</b>
 f(x) =(e^*-(x^2) / (2 * sigma^2))

The graph of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function">gaussian</a> is a characteristic symmetric "bell curve" shape that 
quickly falls off towards zero. 
<br>
The parameter a is the height of the curve's peak, b is the position of the center of the peak, and 
c (the standard deviation) controls the width of the "bell".  
<br>
Gaussian functions are widely used in statistics where they describe the 
normal distributions, in signal processing where they serve to define Gaussian filters, in image processing where two-dimensional Gaussians 
are used for Gaussian blurs, and in mathematics where they are used to solve heat equations and diffusion equations and to define the Weierstrass transform.
<br>
<ul>
<li>transferFunction.sigma - width of the bell?</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Linear</b>
f(x) = slope*x
<br>
In calculus, analytic geometry and related areas, a linear function is a polynomial of degree one or less, including the zero polynomial (the latter not being considered to have degree zero).
<br>
<b>Log</b>
f(x) = log(x)
<ul>
<li>transferFunction.slope - Slope of the line</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Ramp</b>
The ramp function generates a straight line with the given slope for all inputs within the acceptable range.  Inputs outside of the range get clamped to the high or low limit.
<br>
<ul>
<li>transferFunction.slope - Slope of the line</li>
<li>transferFunction.xHigh - the high input limit</li>
<li>transferFunction.xLow - the low input limit</li>
<li>transferFunction.yHigh - the high output limit</li>
<li>transferFunction.yLow - the low output limit</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Sgn</b>
The Sgn function returns a 1 for anything > 0 and a -1 for anything < 0
<br>
<b>Sigmoid</b>
f(x) = 1/(1+ e^(-slope*x))
<br>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">sigmoid</a> function is a mathematical function having an "S" shape (sigmoid curve).
 It is used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of the argument, or another example is the ogee curve as used in the 
spillway of some dams. A wide variety of sigmoid functions have been used as the activation function of artificial 
neurons, including the logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions. Sigmoid curves are also common in statistics as 
cumulative distribution functions, such as the integrals of the logistic distribution, the normal distribution, 
and Student's t probability density functions.
<br>

<ul>
<li>transferFunction.slope</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Sin</b>
f(x) = sine(x)
The Sin function returns the Sine value of the input.
<br>
<b>Step</b>
The step function returns the high output limit for x > 0 and the low output limit for x <= 0
<br>
<ul>
<li>transferFunction.yHigh - the high output limit</li>
<li>transferFunction.yLow - the low output limit</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Tanh</b>
The Tanh function returns 1 for any input > 100 and -1 for any input > -100.
For values within this range the following formula is used:
f(x) = (e^(slope*x)-1)/(e^(slope*x)+1)
<br>
Settings:
<ul>
<li>transferFunction.slope</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Trapezoid</b>
The Trapezoid function:
<br>
For any x that is both >= Left and Right high: f(x) = 1 
<br>
For any x that is > leftLow and < leftHigh: f(x) = (x - leftLow)/(leftHigh - leftLow)
<br>
For any x that is > rightHigh and < right Low: f(x) = (rightLow -x)/(rightLow - rightHigh)
<br>
For any other x : f(x) = 0
<br>
Settings:
<ul>
<li>transferFunction.leftLow</li>
<li>transferFunction.leftHigh</li>
<li>transferFunction.rightLow</li>
<li>transferFunction.rightHigh</li>
</ul>
